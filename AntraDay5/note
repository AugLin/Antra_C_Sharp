LINQ: Language Integrated Query and its a SQL like Syntax to help us talk to different data source.

In memory data source: Data temporarily stored in our application; List, Array
Out of memory data source: Database

Data Providers with LINQ

    1. LINQ to Objects: In memory data source like list or array, etc; the return type is going to be IEnumerable
    2. LINQ to Database: Work with ADO.Net
    3. LINQ to SQL: Talk to SQL server database
    4. LINQ to Entities: Talk to other SQL db, entity framework as ORM - the return type is IQueryable
    
LINQ is also a bunch of extension methods that provides multiple Query expressions on IEnumerable<T> interface.

****
First: Will return the first record when there is one or more matching value found and if no matching value found,
    it will throw an exception.
    
FirstOrDefault: Will return the first record when there is one or more matching value found and if no matching value found,
                    it will assign null;
                    
Single: Will return the record when there is one and only one record matching value found. If no value found it will 
            Throw an exception.
            
SingleOrDefault: Will return the record when there is one and only one record matching value found. If no value found it will 
                     assign null.
            
Use case
    1. Use SingleOrDefault if searching on Unique Key or Primary Key
    
Quantifier Operator *                    
    1. Any(): Checks if any elements satisfy the specific condition. If yes return true
    2. All(): Check all elements satisfy the specific condition, if yes return true.
